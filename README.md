## ðŸ“‹ User Requirements
To successfully gain access, the user must complete the following five tasks:

1. **Turn off WIFI**:  
   - The app monitors the device's WiFi status and checks if it has been disabled.
2. **Turn on Bluetooth**:  
   - Bluetooth must be enabled for this step to turn the corresponding box green.
3. **Ensure their location is in Israel**:  
   - The app uses GPS and location services to verify if the user's geographical coordinates are within Israel.
4. **Tap the "Sign In" button three times**:  
   - The button tracks how many times it has been tapped and only completes the task after exactly three presses.
5. **Set the screen brightness to maximum**:  
   - The app detects and verifies if the screen brightness has been set to its highest level.

For every task completed, one of five boxes turns **green**, indicating progress. When all five boxes are green, the app redirects the user to the next screen with a success message.
